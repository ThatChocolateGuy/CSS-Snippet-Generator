# CSS Snippet Generator

Generate formatted CSS which would otherwise be tedious to code by hand.

Using variables and a bit of custom logic, you can generate repetitive code snippets with parameters that differ slightly from snippet-to-snippet.

Clone the repo and replace the sample code in the `<pre>` block with your own. Use the `<span class="nocode">` blocks to play with your variables. You can inspect the existing logic tied to the `id` attributes (`postNumber` & `thumbnail`) for an example on how this works.

Project utilizes the [prettify.js](https://github.com/google/code-prettify) library by Google and [Vim Sunburst Theme](https://github.com/google/code-prettify/blob/master/styles/sunburst.css) by David Leibovic.
