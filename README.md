#CSS Snippet Generator

Generate formatted CSS which would otherwise be tedious to code by hand.

Using variables and a bit of custom logic, you can generate repetitive code snippets with parameters that differ slightly from snippet-to-snippet.

Clone the repo and replace the sample code in the <pre><pre></pre></pre> block with your own. Use the <pre><span class="nocode"></span></pre> blocks to play with your variables. You can inspect the existing logic tied to the <pre>id</pre> attributes (<pre>postNumber</pre> & <pre>thumbnail</pre>) for an example on how this works.
